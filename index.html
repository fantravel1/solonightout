                            <p>Going out alone is a skill you build, not an awkward situation you endure. Start with a low-pressure venue like a calm wine bar with counter seating or a late-night cafe with a good book. Choose places where solo guests are common — SoloNightOut rates every venue with a SoloScore&#8482; so you know exactly how solo-friendly it is before you arrive.</p>
                            <p>Begin with our <strong>One Perfect Hour&#8482;</strong> framework: one drink, one walk, one beautiful moment — then head home feeling accomplished, not exhausted. The more you do it, the more natural it becomes. Most people find that after the first 10 minutes, the awkwardness evaporates entirely.</p>

                            <p>The <strong>One Perfect Hour&#8482;</strong> is SoloNightOut's signature framework: arrive at a counter-seating restaurant at 7pm for one beautiful course, take a 20-minute walk through a well-lit neighborhood, stop at a wine bar for one glass at the counter, then head home.</p>
                            <p>The entire experience is roughly 60-90 minutes — enough to feel alive, not enough to feel drained. Every SoloNightOut city guide includes specific One Perfect Hour plans with exact venues, walking routes, and timing.</p>

                            <p>Safe solo evening neighborhoods share key traits: well-lit streets, active foot traffic without chaos, proximity to reliable transit, a mix of restaurants and cafes (not just bars), and a culture where walking alone is completely normal.</p>
                            <p>SoloNightOut provides neighborhood-by-neighborhood comfort maps for every city we cover, with honest safety notes. Not to create fear — but to help you choose where you'll feel most at ease.</p>

                            <p>Every SoloNightOut city guide includes a "How Locals Do Solo Nights" section. In Tokyo, locals frequent standing bars and ramen counters. In Paris, it's a cafe terrace with a book and a glass of wine. In Lisbon, locals walk the Alfama and stop for a pastel de nata and a ginjinha.</p>
                            <p>Understanding what's culturally normal in each city is the fastest way to feel comfortable going out alone there. When you do what locals do, you blend in naturally.</p>
